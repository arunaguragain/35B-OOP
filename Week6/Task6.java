// 3. Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of an array.

// 4. Write a Java program to revers the element of a one-dimensional array.


// Two Dimensional Array

// 1. Write a java program to Add two 2x3 matrices

// 2. Write a java program to print transpose 2X2 matrices

// 3. Write a java program to print mirror 2X2 matrices

// 4. Write a java program to Multiply two 2x3 matrices


// ArrayList

// 1. Write code that creates an ArrayList that can hold string objects. Add the names of three cars to the ArrayList, and then display the contents of the ArrayList.

// 2. WAP to sort the integer elements of array of size 10 in ascending and descending order using ArrayList.


// Additional Questions (Menu Driven Application)

// 1. Develop a simple menu-driven application in Java that operates on an array of elements. The program will display a Menu with those options and prompt the user to choose his/her option.

// The program should provide the functionalities:

// 1.    Add an element to the array

// 2.    Display all the elements of the array

// 3.    Reverse the elements of the array

// 4.    Find the largest element of the array

// 5.    Find the smallest element of the array

// 6.    Exit the program


// Note: Based on the user's selection, the program will perform the corresponding operation and display the result or carry out the desired action. The program will continue to show the menu until the user chooses the option to exit.


// 2. Develop a simple menu-driven student grading system program in Java that operates on an array of student grades. The program will display a Menu with those options and prompt the user to choose his/her option.

// The program should provide the functionalities:

// 1.    Add a grade to the system

// 2.    Display all grades

// 3.    Calculate the average grade

// 4.    Find the highest grade

// 5.    Find the lowest grade

// 6.    Exit the program


// Note: Based on the user's selection, the program will perform the corresponding operation and display the result or carry out the desired action. The program will continue to show the menu until the user chooses the option to exit.
